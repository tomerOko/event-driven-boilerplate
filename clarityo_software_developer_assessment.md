  Clarity Software Developer Assessment
  <br>
</h1>

## Congratulations 🎉 !

We are happy to see you here, if you are reading this that means both of us would like to continue the interview process. 💪🖥

In this part, we would like to assess your coding and architecture skills, with **2 separate unrelated questions**.

❗Please ***upload your solutions to the repository at least 4 hours prior to the interview.***

❔If any of the requirements are unclear or you have any questions you are welcome to contact us and we will be happy to help.

Beside the basic requirements the rest is up to you, please make assumptions regarding anything that is not described based on your experience & knowledge. 🧠📚

> **Note:** you are more than welcome to present code and or architecture you have already created, as long as they are created by you, are relatively recent ( past 6 months ), and meet the same requirements as described below 



# Coding Assessment  

Please prepare the code as if it was going to be deployed to production, it is not required to have everything ready but do document what is missing so we can discuss it later.

 #### Business Requirement
```
As a restaurant owner, I need to keep a list of my employees so I can integrate into my enterprise application systems for HR purposes.
```
##### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- Working service that allows basic CRUD operations for employee records via REST API
- Service should be written in node.js
- Service should run locally and be public cloud ready

##### ❌ Out of Scope

- Persistent data storage (no need for DB, data can be stored in memory)
- Security
- UI

##### 🗣 Post Discussion

- DB options
- How the service can be deployed
- Scalability & Elasticity
- Devops
- API Versioning



# Design Assessment    


Please design a high-level diagram with a solution for the scenario described below 📊

- Do not try to solve every detail, focus on architectural principles and main components. 
- Take assumptions regarding usage patterns, client needs, etc 
```
A retailer that wants to go omni-channel - the ability to have seamless customer experience across multiple channels.
For example, a customer may start an order online, go to the store, buy more items, and pay for the entire transaction altogether. 
Some of the items will be supplied immediately and some will be shipped later. 
```
Prepare to explain your solution and the reasoning behind it.

## 🍀 Good Luck ! 🍀
